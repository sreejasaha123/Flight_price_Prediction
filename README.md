# Flight_price_Prediction

## Project overview
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts flight prices based on various factors, such as departure time, duration, airline, and other relevant features. This helps in understanding pricing trends and assists users in making cost-effective travel decisions.

### Tools
Programming Language: Python

#### Libraries:
Data Preprocessing: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Modeling: XGBoost, Scikit-learn (for other models)

##### Key Takeaways:
Data Preprocessing: Proper handling of missing values, outliers, and feature scaling significantly improved model performance.
Model Selection: XGBoost demonstrated its ability to capture complex relationships in the data, outperforming other algorithms.
Business Application: This model can assist airlines, travel agencies, and end-users in predicting and planning around dynamic flight pricing trends.
